		<p>WEEK TWO SONIC COMPOSITIONS</p>

		<p>"You Know You're Right" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by lead vocalist and guitarist, Kurt Cobain. It is the first song on the band's self-titled greatest hits album and the last song the band recorded before Cobain's death in April 1994. Released as a promo single, "You Know You're Right" reached number one on both Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts.</p>

		<p>The song was written in 1993. For years, it was known only from a bootlegged live version, recorded on October 23, 1993 at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago, Illinois, and from a performance of the song by the American grunge band Hole (fronted by Cobain's widow, Courtney Love) during the band's MTV Unplugged set in 1995.</p><br>
