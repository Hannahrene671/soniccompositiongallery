				<h1>I want you to want me
				But you just wanna love me for the day
				And I can't just walk away
				Even though I know you're trouble, babe
				So I'mma take my time
				Go with the flow, can't get too involved
				You got a face that I
				Just can't say no to
				Just can't say no to you
				You know I want you baby
				You know I do
				I'll give you my heart and the rest is up to you
				You ain't no good for me, I know it's true
				But you don't have to be
				'Cause I do it for the thrill, for the rush
				I do it for the pain, for your touch
				When I OD, when it's too much
				If I survive, baby you're the one
				You're the one
				Babe
				I feel like I'm walking
				The tightrope of love in your circus babe
				If I were a fella it'd be my last day
				Even though you're right under me
				So I'mma take my time
				Go with the flow, can't get too involved
				You got a face that I just can't say no to
				Just can't say no to you
				You know I want you baby
				You know I do
				I'll give you my heart and the rest is up to you
				You ain't no good for me, I know it's true
				But you don't have to be, 'cause I do it
				For the thrill, for the rush
				I do it for the pain, for your touch
				Will I OD, when it's too much?
				If I survive, baby you're the one
				You're the one
				You're the one
				You're the one
				You're the one
				Take my time
				Go with the flow, can't get too involved
				You got a face that I
				Just can't say no to, just can't say no to you</h1>
