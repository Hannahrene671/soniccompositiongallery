		<p>WEEK SIX SONIC COMPOSITIONS</p>

		<p>Purple Rain is the sixth studio album by American recording artist Prince, released on June 25 1984 by Warner Bros. Records. It is the first to feature the billing of his band the Revolution, and is the soundtrack to the 1984 film of the same name. Purple Rain was musically denser than Prince's previous albums, emphasizing full band performances, and multiple layers of guitars, keyboards, electronic synthesizer effects, drum machines, and other instruments. As with many massive crossover albums, Purple Rain's consolidation of myriad styles, from pop rock to R&B to dance, is generally acknowledged to account in part for its enormous popularity.</p>	<br>

				<h1>I never meant to cause you any sorrow
				I never meant to cause you any pain
					I only wanted to one time to see you laughing
					I only wanted to see you
					Laughing in the purple rain
					Purple rain, purple rain
					Purple rain, purple rain
					Purple rain, purple rain
					I only wanted to see you
					Bathing in the purple rain
				I never wanted to be your weekend lover
				I only wanted to be some kind of friend
				Baby, I could never steal you from another
				It's such a shame our friendship had to end
				Purple rain, purple rain
				Purple rain, purple rain
				Purple rain, purple rain
				I only wanted to see you
				Underneath the purple rain
				Honey, I know, I know
				I know times are changing
				It's time we all reach out
				For something new, that means you too
				You say you want a leader
				But you can't seem to make up your mind
				I think you better close it
				And let me guide you to the purple rain
				Purple rain, purple rain
				Purple rain, purple rain
					If you know what I'm singing about up here
				C'mon, raise your hand
					Purple rain, purple rain
					I only want to see you Only want to see you
					In the purple rain</h1>
