		<p>WEEK FOUR SONIC COMPOSITIONS</p>

		<p>Perrey was born Jean Leroy in France on 20 January 1929. He was studying medicine in Paris when he met Georges Jenny, the inventor of the Ondioline, a type of electronic keyboard. Quitting medical school, Perrey travelled through Europe demonstrating this precursor of the modern synthesizer. At the age of 30, Perrey relocated to New York, sponsored by Caroll Bratman, who built him an experimental laboratory and recording studio. Here he invented "a new process for generating rhythms with sequences and loops", utilising the environmental sounds of "musique concr√®te."Befriending Robert Moog, he became one of the first Moog synthesiser musicians, creating "far out electronic entertainment."</p>	<br>
